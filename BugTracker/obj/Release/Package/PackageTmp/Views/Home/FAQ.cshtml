            <h3>What is Bug Tracker?</h3>
            <p>Bug Tracker is a web application that allows the tracking of support tickets for web development projects.</p>
            <h3>What are the different user roles and what do they do?</h3>
            <p>Admins can assign user roles, in addition to everything that project managers can do. They can view and edit all tickets.</p>
            <p>
            Project Managers can create, edit, archive, and view any project. They can also assign users to projects and to tickets. They can view and edit all tickets belonging to the projects they are assigned to, and can also add comments and attachments to these tickets. When a Developer submits a ticket as Resolved, a Project Manager may close the ticket. Project managers can delete any comment or attachment on the tickets they can access.</p>
            <p>
                Developers can be assigned a ticket by a Project Manager, and can submit the ticket as Resolved for a Project Manager's approval. They can view and edit all tickets assigned to them, as well as add comments and attachments to these tickets. They can delete their own comments and attachments.</p>
                <p>Submitters may submit new tickets for all projects they are assigned to. They can view and edit all tickets they create, as well as add comments and attachments to these tickets. They can delete their own comments and attachments.</p>
                <h3>How do I submit a new ticket for a project?</h3>
                <p>Navigate to the project you want to create a new ticket for, and click on "New Ticket". You will not be able to create a new ticket unless you have the "Submitter" user role. Contact an Admin to have this role added to your account.</p>
                <h3>What does the status of the ticket mean?</h3>
                <p>Open tickets have not yet been assigned to anyone.</p>
                <p>Pending tickets have been assigned to a developer, but have not yet been resolved.</p>
                <p>Resolved tickets have been determined to be fully addressed by the assigned developer, and are waiting for a project manager's approval.</p>
                <p>Closed tickets have been determined to be fully addressed by a project manager. Closed tickets can no longer be edited or assigned to another user.</p>
                <h3>I finished addressing the issues on a ticket. What now?</h3>
               <p>If you are a Developer, navigate to the ticket and click the "Resolve" button. This will send an email to all Project Managers in the ticket's project, and a Project Manager will either close the ticket or contact you with additional information concerning what is needed to close the ticket.</p>
              <h3>When are e-mail notifications sent out?</h3>
            <p>E-mail notifications are sent in the following scenarios:</p>
            <p>When a submitter creates a new ticket, an e-mail notification is sent to all the project managers belonging to the ticket's project.</p>
            <p>When a project manager assigns a ticket to a developer, the developer is notified by e-mail.</p>
            <p>Whenever a ticket is edited, assigned to a different developer, closed, or a new comment or attachment is added, an e-mail is sent to the ticket's assigned developer.</p>
            <p>When a developer submits a ticket as "Resolved", an e-mail is sent to all the project managers belonging to the ticket's project.</p>
